things to know:

will the lead and theta affect the variation
if not then is it possible

this is a regression problem
(logistic regression may be applied to obtain a graph of variation)

variation parameters(graphical)         _
    max and min value            _     / \
    frequency                   / \   /   \          _____    /
    mean                       /   \_/     \        /     \ _/
    standard deviation        /             \______/

variation parameters(non graphical)
    lead
    angle

(now the main algo will work)
